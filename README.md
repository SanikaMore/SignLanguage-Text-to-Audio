# SignLanguage-Text-to-Audio
This system can interpret sign language gestures captured by a camera or sensor, and convert them into written text and further into audio.  The system then uses text-to-speech (TTS) technology to generate audible speech output, allowing non-sign language users to understand and respond to the sign language of the user's message.
